// Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
// or odd using the ternary operator.

// Ans : when you want to do conditional operation that time it is used . it is short hand way to write "if else".
// Syntax : condition ? True : false

let a=4;
let even_or_not=a%2==0 ? "even" : "Not a Even number"
console.log(`${a} is ${even_or_not}`);
